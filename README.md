# Galactic Whirlphool

This code uses the Python Turtle library to create a stunning, swirling pattern that appears to pull the viewer in, like a vortex. The pattern is formed by drawing a series of connected lines with increasing lengths, with each line being drawn in a different color from a predefined palette. The turtle module is used to control the turtle's movements and appearance.

# Features
Rainbow colors: The pattern features a vibrant, rainbow palette of colors, with a smooth transition between each color.
Swirling shape: The lines are drawn in a way that creates a swirling, vortex-like shape, with each line overlapping the previous one.
Increasing complexity: The pattern becomes increasingly complex as the lines get longer, creating a sense of depth and dimensionality.


# Run
To run this code, save it to a file with a .py extension (e.g., rainbow_vortex.py) and execute it using Python (e.g., python rainbow_vortex.py). This will launch a window displaying the Rainbow Vortex pattern.
